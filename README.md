# No Waste Neko
An web application aimed to reduce household food wastage due to expiry dates by
1. Helping users track their food products with minimal user input for a more fuss-free experience;
2. Suggesting recipes based user's prefrences chosen from a gamified quiz to use up leftover ingredients; and
3. Spreading awareness in forms of fun facts and trivias.
